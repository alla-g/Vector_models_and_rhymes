# Vector models and rhymes

Here are two files that contain code for my coursework 'Effect of rhyme on embeddings in the poetry corpus'.

File 'Creating corpora and models.ipynb' demonstrates how the three different corpora files were created from one (including all preprocessing) and how the 12 different vector models were built. File 'Exploring the models.ipynb' contains all experiments and tests that were performed on the models. Also there are all diagrams and tables that were demonstated in the text of the work.  

You do not need to install any additional soft to open the files. They are in the .ipynb format that can be opened directly on GitHub without runnig the code. Though in some cases GitHub is not able to load the files correctly and then to open it you will need to download it on your computer.
